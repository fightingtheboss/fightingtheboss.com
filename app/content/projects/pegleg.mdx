Pegleg crowd-sourced full-length movies from YouTube. It was built with Meteor, a full-stack Javascript framework that makes creating real-time web applications simple, quick and fun.

This app used data from TMDB along with the YouTube API to do a customized search for videos that could be the full-length film. Users determined if a particular video was actually the film in question by voting. Videos with enough downvotes, along with those that are no longer available on YouTube, are automatically removed. Multi-part videos were supported and were automatically joined into a playlist when any individual part was added.
