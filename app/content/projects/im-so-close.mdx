After being workshopped at the 2008 Summerworks Festival and winning the Spotlight Award for best company,
Theatre Why Not hired me to make their promotional materials for the full production in 2010.
I did the design and photography after discussing the show's themes with director Ravi Jain
and collaborated with illustrator Chris Simonen on the hand-drawn type and illustrations.

These designs were completed in a lot of random locations, including the back of a car on the way to Napa Valley.
