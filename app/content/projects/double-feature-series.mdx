In the winter of 2009 I had a projector, an empty photo studio,
and some popcorn so I decided to curate a weekly double feature night,
pairing a classic film with a thematically-related modern film.
The series ran for six weeks and each week I designed a new poster promoting the night.
I have a list of many more fantastic double feature nights, we'll see if the opportunity comes up again.
