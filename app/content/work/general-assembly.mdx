Bitmaker (aka [General Assembly Toronto](https://generalassemb.ly)) was a tech skills accelerator (aka a coding bootcamp) that taught Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and other web development technologies, alongside other tech sector skills like UX design and product management.

After several years in London working with [MUBI](/work/mubi), I returned to Toronto and started teaching web development part-time to the second cohort at Bitmaker. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge with the passionate and brave students so much that I joined full-time soon after, working on both building curriculum and developing in-class and back-office software for the growing business. I eventually became the CTO and Head of Instruction, managing a team of around 20 part-time and full-time instructors and developers, as well as overseeing the curriculum and technology stack.

[Bitmaker was acquired by General Assembly in late 2016](https://betakit.com/torontos-bitmaker-acquired-by-general-assembly/), and I worked to integrate the two companies' curriculums and technologies. I left in early 2018 to pursue an opportunity to work with some former students and colleagues from Bitmaker at Shopify.
